# Bitcoin Abbreviated: A P2P Electronic Cash System

The PDF in this folder is an abbreviated version of the Bitcoin white paper paraphrased by Justin Huang. It also has a few notes including more contemporary terminology, such as the **blockchain** and **mining**. The original LaTeX file is also here, if you're curious.

If you would like to read the original (which we highly recommend), follow [this link](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Additionally, 3Blue1Brown has a good video on the topic, which covers a lot of material from the white paper, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&t=1308s).
